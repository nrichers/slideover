# From the bottom, toggle manually

<br><br>Yup, that's it.

::: {.slideover--b}
Enable collapsible overlays in Quarto Revealjs presentations:

```code
format: 
  revealjs:
    revealjs-plugins: 
      - slideover
```

**Usage example**

```code
::: {.slideover--b}
Slideover text.
:::
```
:::


# From the bottom, auto-collapse

Toggles the slideover after five seconds.

::: {.slideover--b .auto-collapse}
Add `.auto-collapse` to the slideover:

```code
::: {.slideover--b .auto-collapse}
Slideover text that collapses after five seconds.
:::
```
:::

# From the<br>right,toggle<br>manually

::: {.slideover--r}

This content slides over from the right side of the slide.

**Usage example**

```code
::: {.slideover--r}
Slideover text.
:::
```

**Tips & tricks**

- Slideover provides only limited styling support.<br>For example, **bolding** and _italics_ are supported.
- For better styling, use [Tachyons Extension For Quarto](https://github.com/nareal/tachyons).
- Headings have special meaning to Quarto and Pandoc and are NOT supported inside slideovers.

# One more thing,<br>for the lefties.

::: {.slideover--l}

Content can also slide over from the left side, sinisterly.

**Usage example**

```code
::: {.slideover--l}
Slideover text from the left.
:::
```

Yes, it's OK to be _sinister_. Take it from someone who is a left-handed and who was forced to write with his right hand.

> The idea that left is sinister comes from Latin, where _sinister_ simply meant "left" but gradually took on meanings like "unlucky" or "evil".
