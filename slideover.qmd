# From the bottom, auto-collapse

Toggles the slideover after five seconds.

::: {.slideover--b .auto-collapse}
Add `.auto-collapse` to the slideover:

**Tips & tricks**

- Slideover provides only limited styling support.<br>For example, **bolding** and _italics_ are supported.
- For better styling, use [Tachyons Extension For Quarto](https://github.com/nareal/tachyons).
- Headings have special meaning to Quarto and Pandoc and are NOT supported inside slideovers.
